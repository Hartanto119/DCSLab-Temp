# DCSLab

Doctor Computer SG Lab

This project is inspired by the desire to create an up to date web app boilerplate and keep evolving.

A web application focusing on the usage of the most popular framework, handpicked with consideration. To meet the everyday programming/coding obstacle and giving the best solution that we can find.  
Sometimes google/stackoverflow searching is enough to satisfied our curiosity, but complex issue such as inter-related components, multi vendors applications problems, hardware software compatibility, bad/slow performances of projects, is something that you can only face it if you do a real projects.  

This project is to 'simulate' the everyday production worthy of obstacles.
